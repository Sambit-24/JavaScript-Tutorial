# Introduction to Javascript

In Web Developement there are three basic languages: 
1. HTML (to create the structure of the page)
2. CSS (to style/design the page)
3. JavaScript (to make the webpage alive)

So basically javascript was created to code the functioning and activities of the web pages.

# Why 'JAVA'script
 Well it has nothing to do with java. When javascript was created it was deployed as livescript and because of the popularity of java those days; it was named javascript. Later it was known as EcmaScript . You'll even see it's verioning as ES1,ES2,EcmaScript 2020 etc.

# How it works ?
 Well unlike other programming language where we have compilers and interpreters to convert the code from high level to byte or machine level codes; as initially it was developed to work in web browser.JavaScript provides JS-Engines which are embedded with our web browsers. So, we don't need any other translator other than our web browser to run our JS code. 

# What Engine ?
## well there are various types of javascript engines which helps us to run our JS code. They:
1. reads the script
2. Then it compiles the script to machine code
3. the machine code executes
## there are specific engines for different browser like V8 (Chrome), SpiderMonkey(Firefox), Chakra (Edge) etc.

## Note:- 
Although JS was initially designed only for web page activities but now-a-days there are other engines and frameworks which makes javascript to run on system (like Node.JS) in which we can do various operations like networking,request/response,server scripting etc.

# JS in Browser
In browser JS can:
1. create new elements, change the existing content and modify it.
2. interact with user activities
3. connect client and server sides etc.

# Chrome developer tool
You can run js code on chrome browser by opening your console on your web browser as guided below 
To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: "Cmd + Option + J" (on a Mac) or
"Ctrl +Shift +J (on Windows).
Then write your code in console for ex:
```
2+3
```
--it'll give answer as 5

or input this command
``` 
alert('hello chiku')

```
there will be a pop up saying 'hello chiku'.Press OK button to continue in the popup

That's it for this tutorial, there is also hand written notes attached to this repo. I'll add more soon.Be with me guys thank you
